# Efficacy-Verification-of-Users-Using-BLUFADE-Blurred-Face-Detection

The project is made to cope with the problem of
idle PCs when left unattended. This is the ideal scenario for
the malicious user to conduct a lunchtime attack. A lunchtime
attack, as the name suggests, refers to the user leaving their
device unattended, while they are at lunch, which makes it
susceptible for the attacker to perform malicious tasks. There
are numerous models which could be utilized to overcome
this attack. A popular method was to capture live images and
videos of the users and store them in the database. Thus, when
the user leaves the device unattended, it should automatically
log out. The scope of this project, however, was to design and
develop a methodology that could maintain the privacy of the
user, while allowing them to utilize this model to its fullest
extent. This was accomplished by trying to deblur the images
with different techniques. It was followed by calculating the
dissimilarity of consecutive video frames of the same person
and the dissimilarity between the frames of a person with all
other frames of other people. The person is authenticated if
the value is above a certain pre-defined threshold
